The system will give the opportunity to the users to share any products with others and encourage the efficient use of resources by sharing unused items. Let’s share has the functionality which allows users to send a message to the owner with their request to borrow his or her product. The application also offers the search for significant tools, books or any other necessary things. It also provides notification updates to the users for the update on the shared products.</p>
